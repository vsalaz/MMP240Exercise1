    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I guess I can say a couple things about me since this is the about page. My name is Valentin Salazar, born and raised in Little Italy right in the heart of the Bronx. I like listening to music, recently alot of lo-fi and rap and I like gaming. No console! Well the nintendo switch is alright but I love pc gaming. I like art too but I'm not very good at it but looking at it is nice, right? Anywho this is just a few things about me. Hope to learn lots more in this class!</p>
